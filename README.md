# Boilerplate Infrastructure as Code for Multi-cluster Microservice Architecture on Azure Kubernetes Service
This reference implementation demonstrates my journey for developing fully-automated pipeline for a multi-cluster microservice infrastructure architecture with AKS. This implementation and document is meant to guide an interdisciplinary team or multiple distinct teams like networking, security and development through the process of getting this infrastructure deployed and understanding the components of it.
