# Kubernetes Infrastructure Release
#
# This pipeline's scope is to validate and deploy infrastructural
# changes to the microservice environments with kubernetes. This includes:
#
# * a stage to publish ARM templates and tests
# * a stage to deploy and validate the functional working of the
#   deployed infrastructure in an integration environment
# * the execution of tests scoped to custom roles in the AAD tenant
# * the deployment to the microservice environments
#   * dev
#   * int
#   * prod
#
# This pipeline is automatically triggered on any change in the arm-templates
# folder containing this ADO pipeline definition and infra-as-code.
