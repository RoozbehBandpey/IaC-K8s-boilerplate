# Architecture

This architectural design details fine-grained configurations of care4me recommender infrastructures on Azure. This design is focused on microservices on Azure Kubernetes Services of each component that are crucial for the service as a whole. Topics include configuring DevOps build and release pipeline, kubernetes nodepool and pod deployments, and monitoring across a microservicees.

## Components
This architecture deploys the following components:
>INFO: The workload used in this architecture is stateless. so there is no need for an external storage for storing the state of workload

### Azure DevOps
In this project Azure DevOps is used for issue tracking, code repository, build and release pipelines and storing build artefacts. Most of the infrastructure is deployed with a declarative method, specifically azure pipelines with YAML definition along with ARM templates for each environment. For CLuster CI/CD we have used Flux to automatically synchronize cluster and repository changes. 

1. Developers use Local Process with Kubernetes to run their local development within the context of the development environment Kubernetes cluster. Connecting to the cluster while debugging the service allows quick testing and development in the azure kubernetes.

2. A developer makes changes to the Recommender REST API source code.
3. The code changes are committed to Azure DevOps repository
4. After a pull request approval, continuous integration (CI) process will start
5. Azure DevOps repo triggers a DevOps build pipeline
6. The build job uses a DevOps agent pool to perform a container build process
7. A container image is created from the code in source control, and is then pushed to an Azure Container Registry
8. Through continuous deployment (CD), flux uses one or more operators in the cluster to trigger deployments inside Kubernetes
    * Flux runs in pod in alongside the workload. flux has read-only access to the git repository to make sure that it is only applying changes as requested by developers.
    * Flux recognizes changes in configuration and applies those changes using kubectl commands.
    * Developers do not have direct access to the Kubernetes API through kubectl. 
9. A Grafana instance provides visual dashboards of the application performance based on the data from Azure Monitor.
### Azure Active Directory
For managing Outside-in and Inside-out access. To manage access through Azure Active Directory For MVP we have chosen service principals but it is highly recommended to move to managed identities
### Azure Key Vault
Azure  Key Vault is a managed key store that will hold all infrastructural and operational secrets
### Azure Container Registry
Public images might be subject to unexpected availability issues which can cause operational issues if the image isn't available when service need it therefore all public image, are imported it into container registry.
### Azure Virtual Network
This architecture uses separate subnets which minimizes direct exposure of Azure resources to the public internet.
Three subnets are deployed
1. One to hold the Azure firewall
2. For Azure Bastion
3. For the AKS system
Azure Private Link allocates specific private IP addresses to access Azure Container Registry and Key Vault from Private Endpoints within the AKS system and user node pool subnet.

See [Network Design]() for more details
### Azure Cosmos DB
The backend database, required for storing the backend data for Recommender REST API
>NOTE: Might change to SQL DB
### Azure Log analytics
Container logs are written into elasticsearch instance later pulled over a private link connection into Azure lOg analytics workspace and visualize with Application insight and Grafana. Application insight offer very easy querying capability via `Kusto` and Grafana live dashboards for service health is really beneficial.
### Azure Application Gateway
WAF secures incoming traffic from common web traffic attacks. The instance has a public frontend IP configuration that receives user requests. By design, Application Gateway requires a dedicated subnet.
### Azure Kubernetes Service
#### Ingresses
Since the public facing resources are deployed within their own virtual network, and the incoming traffic is from Application Gateway, it makes sense to incorporate an external ingress controller. Application Gateway has built-in autoscaling capabilities, unlike in-cluster ingress controllers that must be scaled out if they consume an undesired amount of compute resources. External ingress controllers simplify traffic ingestion into AKS clusters, improve safety and performance, and save resources. This architecture uses the Azure Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC) for ingress control. Using Application Gateway to handle all traffic eliminates the need for an extra load balancer. Because pods establish direct connections against Application Gateway, the number of required hops is reduced, which results in better performance.

>INFO: AGIC requires CNI networking to be enabled


* The client sends an HTTPS request to the domain name: mercedes.care4me.com
* Application Gateway has an integrated web application firewall (WAF) and negotiates the TLS handshake for mercedes.care4me.com Application Gateway execute routing rules that forward the traffic to the configured backend. The TLS certificate is stored in Azure Key Vault and it has been made available within cluster via CSI.
* The ingress controller receives the encrypted traffic through the AGIC load balancer. The controller forwards the traffic to the workload pods over HTTP. The certificates are stored in Azure Key Vault and mounted into the cluster using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver.
#### Egress
All egress traffic from the cluster moves through Azure Firewall. Azure Firewall decides whether to block or allow the egress traffic. That decision is based on the specific rules defined in the Azure Firewall or the built-in threat intelligence rules.

For the situations when the cluster needs to communicate with other Azure resources. For instance, pulling an updated image from the container registry. Azure Private Link is used. The advantage is that specific subnets reach the service directly. Also, traffic between the cluster and the service isn't exposed to public internet. For this purpose, Service Endpoint on the subnet must be enabled in order to access the service.

#### Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI)
For Pod-to-pod traffics, Kubernetes NetworkPolicy is used to restrict network traffic between pods. Azure Network Policy is deployed, along with Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI). In this model, every pod gets an IP address from the subnet address space. Resources within the same network can access the pods directly through their IP address. A big advantage of CNI is elimination of additional network overlays. It also offers better security control because it enables the use Azure Network Policy. 


#### Azure Key Vault Secret Store CSI provider
To facilitate the retrieval process, in this architecture we have used Secrets Store CSI driver. When the pod needs a secret, the driver connects with the specified store, retrieves secret on a volume, and mounts that volume in the cluster. The pod can then get the secret from the volume file system.

The CSI driver has many providers to support various managed stores. In this implementation, weâ€™ve chosen the Azure Key Vault with Secrets Store CSI Driver to retrieve the TLS certificate from Azure Key Vault and load it in the pod running the ingress controller. It's done during pod creation and the volume stores both public and the private keys.
#### Flux
Flux is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of configuration, and automating updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy. It uses one or more operators in the cluster to trigger deployments inside Kubernetes. flux monitors all configured repositories, detects new configuration changes, triggers deployments and updates the desired running configuration based on those changes.
#### Helm
It helps to bundle and generalize Kubernetes objects into a single unit that can be published, deployed, versioned, and updated.
#### System and user node pool separation
To prevent misconfigured or rogue application pods from accidentally killing system pods
we have isolated critical system pods from application pods. For deployment the `CriticalAddonsOnly=true:NoSchedule` must be set to prevent application pods from being scheduled on system node pools.
#### AKS-managed Azure AD for role-based access control (RBAC)
Kubernetes supports role-based access control (RBAC) through a set of permissions. Defined by a Role or ClusterRole object for cluster-wide permissions.

Bindings that assign users and groups who are allowed to do the actions. Defined by a RoleBinding or CluserRoleBinding object.

Kubernetes has some built-in roles such as cluster-admin, edit, view, and so on. Bind those roles to Azure Active Directory users and groups to use enterprise directory to manage access.
#### Azure AD pod-managed identities
Azure Active Directory pod-managed identities uses Kubernetes primitives to associate managed identities for Azure resources and identities in Azure Active Directory (AAD) with pods. Administrators create identities and bindings as Kubernetes primitives that allow pods to access Azure resources that rely on AAD as an identity provider.
#### Azure Policy Add-on for AKS
In this reference implementation Azure Policy is enabled when the AKS cluster is created and assigns the restrictive initiative in Audit mode to gain visibility into non-compliance.

The implementation also sets additional policies that are not part of any built-in initiatives. Those policies are set in Deny mode. For example, there is a policy in place to make sure images are only pulled from the deployed ACR.
#### AcrPull
It gives the ability to the cluster  to pull images from the specified Azure Container Registries.
### Azure Bastion
Azure Bastion is used to securely access Azure resources without exposing the resources to the internet. This subnet is used for management and operations only. For infrastructures that deploy multiple virtual networks and subnets Azure Bastion comes really handy for debugging and configuration
### Azure Firewall
The firewall instance secures outbound network traffic. Since most traffic is a web traffic the architecture requires A firewall (WAF) service to help govern HTTP traffic flows.
